Hi,

This application is a demonstration of a currency converter

Covers briefly, the criteria as listed below:

* User Defaults to store data
* MVC - old design patern
* JSON parser for API responses and from a file to an object
* Long polling for continuous rates, background tasking
* Search algorithmsÂ for matching disabled currencies and updated data
* Protocols, delegates and extensions to manage data between
* Storyboard, auto layout
* Tableview operations, custom cells
* Background tasking
* Self documented and clean code.
* Unit Tests, UI Tests and measured code coverage.


Best,
Merve
